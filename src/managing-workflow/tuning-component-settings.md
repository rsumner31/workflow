# Tuning Component Settings

Helm Charts are a set of Kubernetes manifests that reflect best practices for deploying an
application or service on Kubernetes.

After you add the Deis Chart Repository, you can customize the chart using
`helm inspect values deis/workflow | sed -n '1!p' > values.yaml` before using `helm install` to complete the
installation.

There are a few ways to customize the respective component:

 - If the value is exposed in the `values.yaml` file as derived above, one may modify the section of the component to tune these settings.  The modified value(s) will then take effect at chart installation or release upgrade time via either of the two respective commands:

        $ helm install deis/workflow --namespace deis -f values.yaml
        $ helm upgrade deis -f values.yaml

 - If the value hasn't yet been exposed in the `values.yaml` file, one may edit the component deployment with the tuned setting.  Here we edit the `deis-controller` deployment:

        $ kubectl --namespace deis edit deployment deis-controller

    Add/edit the setting via the appropriate environment variable and value under the `env` section and save.  The updated deployment will recreate the component pod with the new/modified setting.

 - Lastly, one may also fetch and edit the chart as served by version control/the chart repository itself:

        $ helm fetch deis/workflow --untar
        $ $EDITOR workflow/charts/controller/templates/controller-deployment.yaml

    Then run `helm install ./workflow --namespace deis --name deis` to apply the changes, or `helm upgrade deis ./workflow` if the cluster is already running.

## Setting Resource limits

You can set resource limits to Workflow components by modifying the values.yaml file fetched
earlier. This file has a section for each Workflow component. To set a limit to any Workflow
component just add `limits_cpu`, `limits_memory` in the section and set them to the appropriate
values.

Below is an example of how the builder section of `values.yaml` might look with CPU and memory
limits set:

```
[builder]
org = "deisci"
pullPolicy = "Always"
dockerTag = "canary"
limits_cpu = "100m"
limits_memory = "50Mi"
```

## Customizing the Builder

The following environment variables are tunable for the [Builder][] component:

Setting                     | Description
--------------------------- | ---------------------------------
DEBUG                       | Enable debug log output (default: false)
BUILDER_POD_NODE_SELECTOR   | A node selector setting for builder job. As builder job sometimes consume a lot of node resources. In case you want a builder job to run in specific node only, so it won't effect the critical node. for example `pool:testing,disk:magnetic`

## Customizing the Controller

The following environment variables are tunable for the [Controller][] component:

Setting                                         | Description

RESERVED_NAMES                                  | a comma-separated list of names which applications cannot reserve for routing (default: "deis, deis-builder, deis-workflow-manager")
SLUGRUNNER_IMAGE_NAME                           | the image used to run buildpack application slugs (default: "quay.io/deisci/slugrunner:canary")
DEIS_DEPLOY_HOOK_URLS                           | a comma-separated list of URLs to send [deploy hooks][] to.

DEIS_DEPLOY_REJECT_IF_PROCFILE_MISSING          | rejects a deploy if the previous build had a Procfile but the current deploy is missing it. A 409 is thrown in the API. Prevents accidental process types removal. (default: "false", allowed values: "true", "false")
DEIS_DEPLOY_PROCFILE_MISSING_REMOVE             | when turned on (default) any missing process type in a Procfile compared to the previous deploy is removed. When set to false will allow an empty Procfile to go through without removing missing process types, note that new images, configs and so on will get updated on all proc types.  (default: "true", allowed values: "true", "false")
KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_DEFAULT_QUOTA_SPEC         | set resource quota to application namespace by setting [ResourceQuota](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/resourcequota/) spec, for example: `{"spec":{"hard":{"pods":"10"}}}`, restrict app owner to spawn more then 10 pods (default: "", no quota will be applied to namespace)

### LDAP authentication settings

Configuration options for LDAP authentication are detailed [here](https://pythonhosted.org/django-auth-ldap/reference.html).

authentication of user accounts in the [Controller][] component:
