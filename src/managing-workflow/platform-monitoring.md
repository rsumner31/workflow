# Platform Monitoring

## Description

We now include a monitoring stack for introspection on a running Kubernetes cluster. The stack includes 3 components:

* [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v0.12/) - Metrics collection daemon written by team behind InfluxDB.
* [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.12/) - Time series database
* [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) - Graphing tool for time series data

## Grafana

Deis Workflow exposes Grafana through the router using [service annotations](https://github.com/deis/router#how-it-works). This
allows users to access the Grafana UI at `http://grafana.mydomain.com`. The default username/password of
`admin/admin` can be overridden at any time by setting the following environment variables in
`$CHART_HOME/workspace/workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE/manifests/deis-monitor-grafana-deployment.yaml`: `GRAFANA_USER` and
`GRAFANA_PASSWD`.

Grafana will preload several dashboards to help operators get started with monitoring Kubernetes and Deis Workflow.
These dashboards are meant as starting points and don't include every item that might be desirable to monitor in a
production installation.

Deis Workflow monitoring does not currently write data to the host filesystem or to long-term storage. If the Grafana
instance fails, modified dashboards are lost. Until there is a solution to persist this, export dashboards and store
them separately in version control.

### Off Cluster Grafana

It is recommended that users provide their own installation for Grafana if possible. The current deployment of Grafana within Workflow is not durable across pod restarts which means custom dashboards that are created after startup will not be restored when the pod comes back up. If you wish to provide your own Grafana instance you can set `grafana_location` in the `values.yaml` file before running `helm install`.

## InfluxDB

InfluxDB writes data to the host disk, however, if the InfluxDB pod dies and comes back on
another host the data will not be recovered. We intend to fix this in a future release. The InfluxDB Admin UI is also
exposed through the router allowing users to access the query engine by going to `influx.mydomain.com`. You will need to
configure where to find the `influx-api` endpoint by clicking the "gear" icon at the top right and changing the host to
`influxapi.mydomain.com` and port to `80`.

** Note: Each user accessing the Influx UI will need to make this change. **

You can choose to not expose the Influx UI and API to the world by updating
`$CHART_HOME/workspace/workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE/manifests/deis-monitor-influxdb-api-svc.yaml` and
`$CHART_HOME/workspace/workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE/manifests/deis-monitor-influxdb-ui-svc.yaml` and removing the
following line - `router.deis.io/routable: "true"`.

### Off Cluster Influxdb

To use off-cluster Influx, please provide the following values in the `values.yaml` file before running `helm install`.

* `influxdb_location=off-cluster`
* `url = "http://my-influxhost.com:8086"`
* `database = "metrics"`
* `user = "InfluxUser"`
* `password = "MysuperSecurePassword"`

## Telegraf

Telegraf is the metrics collection daemon used within the monitoring stack. It will collect and send the following metrics to InfluxDB:

* System level metrics such as CPU, Load Average, Memory, Disk, and Network stats
* Container level metrics such as CPU and Memory
* Kubernetes metrics such as API request latency, Pod Startup Latency, and number of running pods

It is possible to send these metrics to other endpoints besides InfluxDB. For more information please consult the following [file](https://github.com/deis/monitor/blob/master/telegraf/rootfs/config.toml.tpl)

### Customizing

To learn more about customizing each of the above components please visit the [monitor](https://github.com/deis/monitor) repository for more information.
