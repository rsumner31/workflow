# Install Deis Workflow on Azure Container Service

## Check Your Setup

First check that the `helm` command is available and the version is v2.0.0 or newer.

```
$ helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.0.0", GitCommit:"51bdad42756dfaf3234f53ef3d3cb6bcd94144c2", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.0.0", GitCommit:"51bdad42756dfaf3234f53ef3d3cb6bcd94144c2", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

Finally, intialize Helm:
```
helm init
```

Ensure the `kubectl` client is installed and can connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Add the Deis Chart Repository

The Deis Chart Repository contains everything needed to install Deis Workflow onto a Kubernetes cluster, with a single `helm install deis/workflow --namespace deis` command.

Add this repository to Helm:

```
$ helm repo add deis https://charts.deis.com/workflow
```

## Create New Azure Storage Account

It is recommended to use a dedicated storage account for the operational aspects of Workflow, which includes storing slug and container images, database backups, and disaster recovery. This storage account is passed as parameters during the `helm install` command in the next step. Replace the `SA_NAME` variable with a unique name for your storage account and execute these commands.
```
$ export SA_NAME=YourGlobalUniqueName
$ az storage account create -n $SA_NAME -l $DC_LOCATION -g $RG_NAME --sku Standard_LRS
$ export SA_KEY=`az storage account keys list -n $SA_NAME -g RG_NAME --query keys[0].value --output tsv`

```

## Install Deis Workflow

Now that Helm is installed and the repository has been added, install Workflow by running:

```
$ helm install deis/workflow --namespace=deis --set controller.k8s_api_verify_tls=false,global.storage=azure,azure.accountname=$SA_NAME,azure.accountkey=$SA_KEY,azure.registry_container=registry,azure.database_container=database,azure.builder_container=builder
```

Helm will install a variety of Kubernetes resources in the `deis` namespace.
Wait for the pods that Helm launched to be ready. Monitor their status by running:

```
$ kubectl --namespace=deis get pods
```

If it's preferred to have `kubectl` automatically update as the pod states change, run (type Ctrl-C to stop the watch):

```
$ kubectl --namespace=deis get pods -w
```

Depending on the order in which the Workflow components initialize, some pods may restart. This is common during the
installation: if a component's dependencies are not yet available, that component will exit and Kubernetes will
automatically restart it.

Here, it can be seen that the controller, builder and registry all took a few loops before they were able to start:

```
$ kubectl --namespace=deis get pods
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
deis-builder-hy3xv            1/1       Running   5          5m
deis-controller-g3cu8         1/1       Running   5          5m
deis-database-rad1o           1/1       Running   0          5m
deis-logger-fluentd-1v8uk     1/1       Running   0          5m
deis-logger-fluentd-esm60     1/1       Running   0          5m
deis-logger-sm8b3             1/1       Running   0          5m
deis-minio-4ww3t              1/1       Running   0          5m
deis-registry-asozo           1/1       Running   1          5m
deis-router-k1ond             1/1       Running   0          5m
deis-workflow-manager-68nu6   1/1       Running   0          5m
```

Once all of the pods are in the `READY` state, Deis Workflow is up and running!

Next, [configure dns](dns.md) so you can register your first user and deploy an application.
